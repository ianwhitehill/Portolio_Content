            After 8 years of teaching and 6,000+ graduates, we can tell you the biggest problem in tech ed is that most bootcamps require incoming students to have a significant background in coding to join. Not only does this let bootcamps off the hook in terms making an effective curriculum, it simply DOESN’T work. It’s been proven over and over that the most reliable predictors of success in coding bootcamps are traits like dedication, resilience, and curiosity. That’s why our application process looks for these characteristics in new students, and we don’t require anyone to come into bootcamp with 100+ hours of coding experience under their belts.
